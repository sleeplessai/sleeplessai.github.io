# Project Constellation Dev1

Project Constellation had been officially released in 2019 January as my brand new blog powered by Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

To witness the growth of Project Constellation, see [DevJournals](https://sleeplessai.github.io/articles/2018-12/constellation-dev1).

## Fork is not Recommended for this Repository

Direct fork is not recommended for this repository while someone wants to create one's own versions.

For this situation I encourage to visit original project at [leonids-jekyll](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids/tree/leonids-jekyll).
